     ssh using passwd instead of pem or pkk file. 
        (privarte and putpblic key pair)

        When you first log into the EC2 instances on AWS , you can only ssh using key pairs.
        so the command to log in looks something like this:

        ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@32.33.34.35 
        But what if you want to enable password ssh?

        We can follow these steps :

        Create an EC2 instance. If you have one already , skip this step.
        Become the super user and open the sshd config file
        sudo su
        vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        Change the PasswordAuthentication no config to
        PasswordAuthentication yes
        Restart the sshd daemon
        service sshd restart
        set the password for the ec2 user /or create new user
        passwd ec2-user
        adduser bob
        passwd bob
        Exit out and try loggin into the EC2 using the password
        ssh ec2-user@32.33.34.35 
        you should now be logged in without using the .pem file
