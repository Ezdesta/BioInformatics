Installing GUI Components:
    # yum -y update
    # yum groupinstall -y "Server with GUI"
    # systemctl set-default graphical.target
    # systemctl default
        ###### NB much shroter way is in the otehr file for Ubuntu as well as for Linux 2 Servers
Setting up XRDP:
    # rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
    Setting up XRDP
            1. Add the xrdp repository to your instance using the following command.

                sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
            2. Install xrdp and tiger VNC server.

                sudo yum install -y xrdp tigervnc-server
            3. Setup SELINUX security using the following commands.

                chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp
                chcon --type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman
            4. Start and enable the xrdp service.

                sudo systemctl start xrdp
                sudo systemctl enable xrdp
            5. Enable RDP port on the instance using the following firewall commands.

                sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=3389/tcp
                sudo firewall-cmd --reload
            6. Set a password for ec2-user . This password will be used to connect to the RDP session.

                sudo passwd ec2-user
            7. Set password for root as you will be prompted for cloud user password for network proxy and color. Login as root and set the password.

                sudo su
                passwd
                Now we have the xdrp components and all instance level settings in the right place. Now let’s test out the RDP connection from an RDP client. In this tutorial, i am using windows RDP client.

                Connecting the Instance Using RDP
                Note: Make sure you have opened RDP port in your instance security group.

                1. Open RDP client and type in the public IP of your instance and click connect.

                2. If you get a warning message about remote identity, just click yes.

                3. Now you will get a xrdp authentication window, enter the credentials and click ok.

                Note: The username is “ec2-user” and the password is the password you set for ec2-user in step 6.

                4. You will be prompted to enter the password again. Provide the password and proceed to the steps to configure the initial desktop.

                5. If it prompts for “cloud user password” provide the root user password you set in step 7.

                6. That it, you will get a GUI session as shown below. If you face any errors do let me know in the comment session.



2nd way doing this:
                1) Create a repository file for XRDP. If you do not do this "yum install xrdp" may fail to find the package.
                    vi /etc/yum.repos.d/xrdp.repo
                    
                    add:
                    [xrdp]
                        name=xrdp
                        baseurl=http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/
                        enabled=1
                        gpgcheck=0
                    
                2) Install XRDP and tigervnc-server
                    yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

                3) Start and enable XRDP
                    systemctl start xrdp
                    systemctl enable xrdp
                    
                4) Confirm that you can see port 3389 (TCP RDP port) Listening
                    netstat -anp | grep 3389
                    
                    e.g:
                        [root@rhel-server ~]# netstat -anp | grep 3389
                        tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3389            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1083/xrdp
                    
                5) If your OS firewall is running. Allow RDP (TCP port 3389) through the firewall:
                    systemctl status firewalld
                    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=3389/tcp
                    firewall-cmd --reload

                    *Optionally you could disable the firewall
                    systemctl stop firewalld
                    systemctl disable firewalld
                    
                6) You can modify the XRDP configuration from "/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini"
                    vi /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
                    
                    e.g:
                        [globals]
                        bitmap_cache=yes
                        bitmap_compression=yes
                        port=3389
                        crypt_level=high
                ->		#channel_code=1
                        max_bpp=24
                        #black=000000
                        #grey=d6d3ce
                        #dark_grey=808080
                        #blue=08246b
                        #dark_blue=08246b
                        #white=ffffff
                        #red=ff0000
                        #green=00ff00
                        #background=626c72

                        [xrdp1]
                        name=sesman-Xvnc
                        lib=libvnc.so
                        username=ask
                        password=ask
                        ip=127.0.0.1
                        port=-1
                    
                    Due to an issue I had where the XRDP session would open, display the desktop for a second then close I have commented out channel_code=1. You do not need to do this
                    but if you are having the same issue then this should help.
                    
                7) Open your RDP tool and specify the IP Address or FQDN of your RedHat server. You should be able to log in and see the desktop
                        1) Create a repository file for XRDP. If you do not do this "yum install xrdp" may fail to find the package.
                    vi /etc/yum.repos.d/xrdp.repo
                    
                    add:
                    [xrdp]
                        name=xrdp
                        baseurl=http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/
                        enabled=1
                        gpgcheck=0
                    
                2) Install XRDP and tigervnc-server
                    yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server

                3) Start and enable XRDP
                    systemctl start xrdp
                    systemctl enable xrdp
                    
                4) Confirm that you can see port 3389 (TCP RDP port) Listening
                    netstat -anp | grep 3389
                    
                    e.g:
                        [root@rhel-server ~]# netstat -anp | grep 3389
                        tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3389            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1083/xrdp
                    
                5) If your OS firewall is running. Allow RDP (TCP port 3389) through the firewall:
                    systemctl status firewalld

                    firewall-cmd --reload

                    *Optionally you could disable the firewall
                    systemctl stop firewalld
                    systemctl disable firewalld
                    
                6) You can modify the XRDP configuration from "/etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini"
                    vi /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
                    
                    e.g:
                        [globals]
                        bitmap_cache=yes
                        bitmap_compression=yes
                        port=3389

                7) Open your RDP tool and specify the IP Address or FQDN of your RedHat server. You should be able to log in and see the desktop




       RDP to CentOS server setup:    
                 Redhat 7 server/CentOS 7 installed with the GNOME Desktop. 
                        
                        The first thing that we need to do is to add two repos to our CentOS server. 
                        The two commands that you need to run are:

                        sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
                        sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-1.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
                        Next we will install the xrdp software package and then start it as a service. 
                        The commands to do this are:

                        sudo yum -y install xrdp tigervnc-server
                        Sudo systemctl start xrdp.service
                        Now we need to allow the ports for xrdp through the firewall. 
                        After that we’ll need to restart the firewall service. 
                        This can be done by running these commands.

                        sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=public –add-port=3389/tcp
                        sudo firewall-cmd –reload
                        Finally we need to configure SELinux. To do so run these two commands:

                        sudo chcon –type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp
                        sudo chcon –type=bin_t /usr/sbin/xrdp-sesman
                        We can now try to RDP to our CentOS 7 server.

                        First open RDP and type in the IP address of you CentOS 7 Server.
                        If you get certificate warnings click yes to continue.
                        Now enter your CentOS username and password
                        You will now be brought to your CentOS Desktop.
